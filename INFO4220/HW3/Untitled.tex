\begin{theorem}
There are infinitely many primes.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This proof is by contradiction. Suppose there are a finite number of primes $p_1,\ldots,p_n$. We construct a new number $m$ as
\[ m = 1 + \prod_{i = 1}^n p_i\]
We see that for all primes $p_i$, $m \mod p_i = 1$. Therefore no prime $p_i$ divides $m$. Therefore, $m$ must be prime, and by contradiction the number of primes is infinite.
\end{proof}
